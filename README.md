## Positron emission tomography (PET) 
is a medical imaging technique that uses special cameras to create detailed images of the inside of the body. The camera detects and measures the emission of radioactive particles called positrons, which are emitted by a special type of tracer that is injected into the patient's body. The tracer is typically a form of a sugar or other small molecule that has been labeled with a radioactive isotope, such as fluorine-18 or carbon-11.

## A tracer 
is a substance that is used in medical imaging techniques such as PET (positron emission tomography) to help visualize and understand the function of the body's organs and tissues. Tracers are typically small molecules, such as sugars or amino acids, that have been labeled with a radioactive isotope, such as fluorine-18 or carbon-11.

When a patient is injected with a tracer, the tracer is absorbed by the body and begins to accumulate in certain organs and tissues. The radioactive isotope in the tracer decays over time, emitting energy in the form of gamma rays or positrons. Special cameras or detectors can then be used to detect and measure the emission of these particles, providing information about the location and distribution of the tracer in the body.

Tracers are used in a variety of medical imaging techniques, including PET, SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography), and PET-CT (PET combined with computed tomography). They can help physicians diagnose a variety of conditions, such as cancer, heart disease, and neurological disorders, by providing detailed information about the function and metabolism of different organs and tissues.

There are many different tracer chemicals that can be used in medical imaging techniques such as PET (positron emission tomography) and SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography). 

Here is a list of some common tracer chemicals and their uses:
- Fluorine-18: to study brain metabolism and blood flow, as well as to detect and diagnose cancer.
- Fluorine-18 (18F) is a fluorine radioisotope which is an important source of positrons. It has a mass of 18.0009380(6) u and its half-life is 109.771(20) minutes. It decays by positron emission 96% of the time and electron capture 4% of the time. Both modes of decay yield stable oxygen-18.
- Carbon-11:  to study brain metabolism and to detect and diagnose cancer. decay 20 minutes 
- Nitrogen-13: to study blood flow and heart function. decay 10 minutes
- Oxygen-15: to study blood flow and metabolism in the brain, heart, and other organs. decay 2 minutes 
- Technetium-99m: to study blood flow and heart function, as well as to detect and diagnose cancer. half-life of approximately 6 hours, emits low energy gamma rays when it decays
- Thallium-201: to study blood flow and heart function.
- Iodine-123: to study brain metabolism and to detect and diagnose cancer.
- Gallium-67: to detect and diagnose cancer.

This list is not exhaustive and there are many other tracer chemicals that can be used in medical imaging. The specific tracer that is used will depend on the type of imaging being performed and the information that the physician is trying to obtain.

## SPECT vs PET

PET (positron emission tomography) and SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) are both medical imaging techniques that use radioactive tracers to visualize and understand the function of the body's organs and tissues. However, there are some key differences between the two techniques:

Energy emissions: PET uses tracers that emit high energy positrons when they decay, while SPECT uses tracers that emit low energy gamma rays. This means that PET detectors are more sensitive and can provide more detailed images, but SPECT detectors are less expensive and more widely available.

Image resolution: PET images tend to have higher resolution than SPECT images because the positrons emitted by the tracer can be detected with higher accuracy. This allows PET to produce more detailed images of the body's organs and tissues.

Image quality: PET images tend to have higher contrast and better spatial resolution than SPECT images, which makes them more useful for detecting and diagnosing certain conditions. However, SPECT images can be improved by combining them with other imaging modalities, such as CT (computed tomography).

Tracer availability: PET tracers are generally more expensive and harder to produce than SPECT tracers, which makes SPECT more widely available in many areas.

Overall, PET and SPECT are both valuable tools for medical imaging, and the choice between the two techniques will depend on the specific information that the physician is trying to obtain  


## Inside a PET machine, 
there is a large, circular gantry that contains the camera and other equipment. The patient lies on a table that is positioned in the middle of the gantry. The table can be moved in and out of the gantry, and the gantry can rotate around the table to create a 3D image of the patient's body.

The camera consists of a series of detectors that are arranged in a circular pattern around the patient's body. These detectors are sensitive to the emission of positrons, and they are used to create a 3D map of the distribution of the tracer in the patient's body. This information is used to create a detailed image of the patient's internal organs and tissues.

In addition to the camera and detectors, a PET machine also includes a computer system to process and analyze the data collected by the camera. The computer system is used to create detailed images of the patient's body and to perform specialized analysis of the tracer distribution, such as measuring the metabolic activity of different organs or tissues.

When a patient is injected with a PET tracer, the tracer begins to accumulate in certain organs and tissues in the body. As the tracer decays, it emits positrons, which are particles with a positive charge. When a positron collides with an electron, the two particles annihilate each other, producing two gamma rays that travel in opposite directions.

The PET camera consists of a series of detectors that are arranged in a circular pattern around the patient's body. These detectors are sensitive to gamma rays, and they are used to measure the direction and energy of the gamma rays produced by the positron-electron annihilations.

The computer system in the PET machine processes and analyzes the data collected by the detectors to create a detailed image of the distribution of the tracer in the patient's body. This information is used to create a 3D map of the patient's internal organs and tissues, which can be displayed on a monitor for the physician to interpret.

The computer system can also perform specialized analysis of the tracer distribution, such as measuring the metabolic activity of different organs or tissues. This can help physicians diagnose a variety of conditions, including cancer, heart disease, and neurological disorders.

## The images produced 
by a PET scan are processed using specialized software in the computer system of the PET machine. This software takes the raw data collected by the camera's detectors and converts it into a 3D image of the patient's body.

The process of creating a PET image typically involves several steps:

## Data acquisition: 
The detectors in the PET camera collect data on the direction and energy of the gamma rays produced by the positron-electron annihilations. This data is stored in the computer system.

## Data reconstruction: 
The raw data collected by the detectors is used to create a 3D map of the distribution of the tracer in the patient's body. This process is known as data reconstruction, and it involves sophisticated algorithms that take into account the geometry of the camera and the physical properties of the tracer.

## Image processing: 
The reconstructed data is then processed to create a detailed image of the patient's internal organs and tissues. This may involve smoothing the image to reduce noise (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_reduction), adjusting the contrast to highlight certain structures (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrast_(vision)) and ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_contrast), or overlaying the image on top of a CT scan to create a more detailed view of the patient's anatomy.

## Image analysis: 
The processed image can then be analyzed by a physician or radiologist to diagnose a variety of medical conditions, including cancer, heart disease, and neurological disorders.

Overall, the process of creating a PET image involves complex mathematical and computational techniques to convert the raw data collected by the camera into a detailed and accurate representation of the patient's internal anatomy.

## Reconstruction algorithms: 
These algorithms are used to reconstruct the 3D distribution of the PET tracer in the patient's body from the 2D data collected by the camera. Reconstruction algorithms often involve techniques such as filtered back projection, maximum likelihood expectation maximization (MLEM), and ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM).

## Smoothing algorithms: 
These algorithms are used to reduce noise in the reconstructed image, which can improve the overall quality and clarity of the image. Smoothing algorithms often involve techniques such as Gaussian smoothing, median filtering, and bilateral filtering.

## Contrast enhancement algorithms: 
These algorithms are used to adjust the contrast of the image, highlighting certain structures or features and making them more visible to the viewer. Contrast enhancement algorithms often involve techniques such as histogram equalization, gamma correction, and edge enhancement.

## Image registration algorithms: 
These algorithms are used to align or overlay multiple images from different imaging modalities, such as PET and CT, to create a more detailed view of the patient's anatomy. Image registration algorithms often involve techniques such as mutual information, normalized cross-correlation, and feature-based registration.

This article describes a new design for an antimatter accelerator that could potentially be small enough to be built on a desktop. Currently, generating high-energy positron beams (which are antimatter particles) requires large, complex equipment such as RF accelerators, which are not practical for use outside of research laboratories. The new design borrows ideas from electron laser-plasma accelerators (ELPAs), which use lasers to accelerate electrons to high energies over a short distance.

The new design involves two stages: the first stage uses a conventional ELPA process to create a high-energy electron flux, and the second stage bounces the electron flux off a metal target, which causes them to decelerate and create a gamma ray. The gamma ray is unstable and converts into a low-energy positron/electron pair, which can then be formed into a high-energy beam. The main advantage of this design is that it only requires a laser system, which currently takes up about 25 square meters of space, making it potentially small enough to be built on a desktop. However, it is still in the early stages of development and has not yet been built as a prototype.
